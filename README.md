🤖 4-DOF Pick and Place Robotic Arm  
**Low-Cost | Arduino-Based | Bluetooth Controlled**

A functional, low-budget **4-DOF articulated robotic arm** designed for simple industrial operations such as gripping, lifting, placing, and releasing objects. Built using easily available components, this system aims to make basic automation accessible for small-scale industries and educational purposes.

## 📌 Introduction  
Modern robotics stems from the concept of *“robot”*—derived from the Czech word **“robota”** (forced labor). Today, robots automate repetitive, hazardous, and high-precision tasks in industries. However, **SMEs often avoid automation due to high cost and complex maintenance**.  

This project provides a **low-cost robotic solution** using off-the-shelf parts, making automation simple and affordable.

## 🔧 Features  
- **4 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**  
- **Bluetooth tele-operation** via HC-05  
- **Arduino Uno as main controller**  
- **Servo motor actuation** for smooth motion  
- **Adjustable motion limits** via code edits  
- **Lightweight structure** suitable for small workloads  
- **Ideal for education, research & prototypes**
