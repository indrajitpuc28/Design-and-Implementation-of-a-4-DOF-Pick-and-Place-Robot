# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-4-DOF-Pick-and-Place-Robot
Robotics began with the term “robot,” meaning forced labor, coined in 1920. Modern robots are computer-controlled manipulators used for repetitive, risky, or precise tasks. This project builds a low-cost 4-DOF pick-and-place robotic arm, tele-operated via Bluetooth, offering an affordable automation solution for small industries.
